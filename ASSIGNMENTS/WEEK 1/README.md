### üíª Steps:
1. Clone this repository or download the `.py` file:
    ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Gamakulo/Project.git
   cd Project
    ```

2. Run the Python program using:
    ```bash
    python calculator.py
    ```
    *(Use `python3` if you're on macOS or Linux)*

3. Follow the prompts:
    - Enter the first number
    - Enter the second number
    - Choose an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)

```plaintext
Enter the first number: 5
Enter operation (+, -, *, /): ^
Enter the second number: 2
Invalid operation. Please choose +, -, * or /.
